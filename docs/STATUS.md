# PokePrism - Current Status

> Read this first for current operational state. This file is the live handoff.

Last updated: 2026-05-05 (session 9 — regression tests + handler bug fixes)

## Current Workstream

PokePrism is post-phase-buildout. The original phase blueprint through Phase 13
and the 2026-05-03 hardening sweep are complete. Active work is ongoing
post-phase development:

- DB-backed card-effect audits and cursor-based handler fixes.
- Card-effect correctness, handler registration, and simulation validation.
- AI/coach hardening and decision-quality follow-up.
- Operational refinement for Docker, Celery, CI, and local workflows.

`docs/AUDIT_RULES.md` and `docs/AUDIT_STATE.md` define the active card audit
workflow. `docs/CARDLIST.md`, `docs/POKEMON_MASTER_LIST.md`, and
`docs/CARD_EXPANSION_RULES.md` are historical or supporting expansion-era docs;
they do not define current audit scope.

## Session 9 Work (2026-05-05)

### Goal
Add focused regression tests for the five handler bugs fixed in Session 8
(commit `b7af4b7`). No new features. No audit cursor advancement.

### Completed

1. **14 regression tests added** (`backend/tests/test_engine/test_audit_fixes.py`):
   - Ninjask Cast-Off Shell (me01-017): 2 tests — Shedinja benched; no-Shedinja no-op
   - Clawitzer Fall Back to Reload (me01-038): 3 tests — hand-only, Water-only,
     max_count=2; condition true/false
   - Grumpig Energized Steps (me01-063): 1 test — top-4 only, any Basic Energy,
     active+bench targets, any number of attachments
   - Fighting Gong (me01-116): 1 test — Basic included; Stage 1/2 excluded
   - Risky Ruins (me01-127): 5 tests — Basic non-Darkness damaged; Darkness no damage;
     evolved no damage; `_play_basic` non-Darkness and Darkness cases; `_place_bench` evolved

2. **2 latent handler bugs fixed** (`backend/app/engine/effects/abilities.py`) — found
   while authoring the regression tests above:
   - `_fall_back_to_reload` / `_cond_fall_back_to_reload`: called `_energy_provides_type`
     which was never imported in `abilities.py` (defined in `trainers.py`). Any game with
     Clawitzer and Water Energy in hand would fire a `NameError` at runtime.
     Fix: inlined as `"Water" in (c.energy_provides or [])`.
   - `_energized_steps`: `state.emit_event(...)` referenced `action.card_def_id` which
     does not exist on `Action` (has `card_instance_id`). Every Grumpig Energized Steps
     resolution would fire `AttributeError`. Fix: replaced with `action.card_instance_id or ""`.

3. **Docker stack rebuilt and restarted** — celery-worker rebuilt after `abilities.py`
   change; full stack `down && up`; worker confirmed healthy.

### Validation (session 9)

| Command | Result |
|---|---|
| `python3 -m pytest tests/test_engine/test_audit_fixes.py -q` | 88 passed |
| `cd backend && python3 -m pytest tests/ -x -q` | **478 passed, 1 skipped** |
| `docker compose ps` | All 8 services Up/healthy |
| `docker compose logs celery-worker` | `celery@... ready.` — clean start |

Frontend not run — no frontend files changed this session.

### Files Changed (session 9)

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `backend/app/engine/effects/abilities.py` | Fixed `_energy_provides_type` NameError (×2) and `action.card_def_id` AttributeError |
| `backend/tests/test_engine/test_audit_fixes.py` | +14 regression tests |
| `docs/HARDENING_SWEEP_REPORT.md` | Session 9 header + regression coverage table added |
| `docs/STATUS.md` | This file |
| `docs/CHANGELOG.md` | Session 9 entry added |

Commit: `980e510` — pushed to `origin/main`. Working tree clean.

### Audit discipline

This was **not** an audit session. `docs/AUDIT_STATE.md` was not advanced.
No DB-backed audit was performed. Cursor is unchanged.

## Known Issues / Gaps

| Issue | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Section 7B Redis stale-running simulation gap | Open | `advance_simulation_queue` beat does not detect stuck-running simulations. Recovery delay: up to 1 hour (Redis visibility timeout). Two remediation options documented in `HARDENING_SWEEP_REPORT.md` Section 7B. |
| "Opponent's next turn" damage-reduction timing | Open — systemic | `incoming_damage_reduction` reset unconditionally in `_end_turn()` before opponent attacks. Affects Gaia Wave, Jasmine's Gaze new-Pokémon clause, etc. Documented in sweep report. |
| Iron Defender / Premium Power Pro / Cinderace Explosiveness | NOOP stubs | Turn-scoped damage modifier and setup-phase placement hooks not implemented; require engine architecture changes. |
| me01-127 Risky Ruins evolved-placement via special effects | Partially deferred | `_place_bench` guard added; no public engine path for evolved special-effect bench placement tested end-to-end. |

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Next recommended task:** Resume DB-backed card-effect audit from current
   `docs/AUDIT_STATE.md` cursor. Run `docs/AUDIT_RULES.md` workflow.
2. **Or:** Run AI/AI or coach simulations now that the stack is clean and all
   known handler bugs are fixed.
3. **Stack note:** Worker runs current code from `980e510`.

## Operational Caveats

- Any change under `backend/app/engine/effects/` requires rebuilding the celery worker:
  `docker compose build celery-worker && docker compose up -d celery-worker`
- `EnergyAttachment` uses `source_card_id=`, not `card_id=`.
- Do not commit `frontend/node_modules`.
- Do not advance `docs/AUDIT_STATE.md` without performing a real DB-backed audit per `docs/AUDIT_RULES.md`.
- Do not reset the database unless explicitly instructed.
