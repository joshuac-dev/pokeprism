Last updated: 2026-05-07 (session 14 — live AI reasoning overlay repair: hide ai_decision console rows; show reasoning only in tile overlay; fix evolved→EVOLVE correlation; add direct ai_reasoning field support)

## Current Workstream

PokePrism is post-phase-buildout. The original phase blueprint through Phase 13
and the 2026-05-03 hardening sweep are complete. Active work is ongoing
post-phase development:

- DB-backed card-effect audits and cursor-based handler fixes.
- Card-effect correctness, handler registration, and simulation validation.
- AI/coach hardening and decision-quality follow-up.
- Operational refinement for Docker, Celery, CI, and local workflows.

`docs/AUDIT_RULES.md` and `docs/AUDIT_STATE.md` define the active card audit
workflow. `docs/CARDLIST.md`, `docs/POKEMON_MASTER_LIST.md`, and
`docs/CARD_EXPANSION_RULES.md` are historical or supporting expansion-era docs;
they do not define current audit scope.

## Authoritative Metrics

These values are a dated local snapshot, not a permanent release baseline.
Re-check them before making claims in user-facing docs.

## Session 14 Work (2026-05-07)

### Goal

Repair the live AI reasoning overlay UX: ai_decision rows were accidentally rendered as
visible purple console rows (session 13), and the frontend container was never rebuilt after
the session 13 commit so old JS was still being served. Fix both issues so the console
remains a plain action/event log while reasoning appears only in the tile overlay.

### Root Cause (two parts)

1. **Stale frontend container**: The `7cc034f` commit added `EventDetail` live reasoning
   logic but the `frontend` container was never rebuilt — nginx was still serving old compiled
   JS with "No AI decision recorded for this event." copy.

2. **Visible `ai_decision` console rows**: Session 13's `LiveConsole.tsx` change rendered
   `ai_decision` events as purple `🤖 ACTION_TYPE — "reasoning…"` rows. User requirement is
   that the console remain a plain game/action log; reasoning belongs only in the tile overlay.

3. **Missing `evolved` → `EVOLVE` correlation**: `EVENT_TO_ACTION` map had `evolve: 'EVOLVE'`
   but the engine emits `"evolved"` (past tense). Clicking an `evolved` row would produce
   action type `'EVOLVED'` (fallback uppercasing), not matching the AI decision's `'EVOLVE'`.

### Completed

1. **`LiveConsole.tsx`** — changed `ai_decision` case from visible purple rows to `skip: true`.
   Events remain in the store array so `EventDetail` can still correlate them; they just don't
   render a visible row. Console is a plain game/action log.

2. **`EventDetail.tsx`** — added `evolved: 'EVOLVE'` to `EVENT_TO_ACTION` map (was missing;
   engine emits `"evolved"`, not `"evolve"`). Added direct `event.data.ai_reasoning` preference:
   if the clicked event carries an `ai_reasoning` field directly, it is used before correlation
   search. Expanded `liveDecision` logic to handle both paths with correct `isLive: true` flag.

3. **`src/test/setup.ts`** — added `Element.prototype.scrollIntoView = vi.fn()` global mock
   so `LiveConsole` tests don't fail on jsdom's missing `scrollIntoView`.

4. **`LiveConsole.test.tsx`** (new, 4 tests):
   - `ai_decision` event produces no visible row (no `live-console-event` nodes).
   - `energy_attached` event still renders as a visible row.
   - `energy_attached` row visible when preceded by hidden `ai_decision`.
   - `evolved` event renders as a visible row.

5. **`EventDetail.test.tsx`** (extended from 7 → 11 tests):
   - `energy_attached` → `ATTACH_ENERGY` correlation finds prior `ai_decision` and shows reasoning.
   - `evolved` → `EVOLVE` correlation finds prior `ai_decision` and shows reasoning.
   - Direct `event.data.ai_reasoning` is preferred over correlation when present.
   - Old copy "No AI decision recorded for this event." is not rendered anywhere.

6. **Container rebuild**: rebuilt `frontend` container; nginx now serves updated JS with
   `"has not been persisted yet"` copy (confirmed via grep on `/usr/share/nginx/html`).

### Goal

Fix the live simulation UI so that clicking a decision/action event in the live console during an AI/H or AI/AI simulation opens the overlay with AI reasoning already populated — not just after the simulation completes.

### Root Cause

`AIPlayer._record_decision()` stores reasoning in `pending_decisions` immediately after choosing an action, but `drain_decisions()` is only called after the entire match finishes in `batch.py`. `MatchMemoryWriter.write_decisions()` writes to Postgres only after a `match_id` exists — also post-match.

`EventDetail.tsx` guarded its DB query on `event.match_id`, which is never present on live WebSocket events. Result: the AI Reasoning section always showed "No AI decision recorded" during a running simulation.

### Completed

1. **Live `ai_decision` engine event** (`backend/app/engine/runner.py`):
   - Added `MatchRunner._maybe_emit_ai_decision(state, pid, action)` helper.
   - Calls `state.emit_event("ai_decision", ...)` with `player`, `action_type`,
     `card_played`, `target`, `reasoning`, and `attack_index` when `action.reasoning` is set.
   - Called at all three strategic decision sites in `_run_turn()`: main-phase loop,
     attack-phase block, and Festival Lead second attack.
   - Filters naturally: only `AIPlayer` sets `action.reasoning`; heuristic/greedy
     players leave it `None`, so no event is emitted for non-AI decisions.
   - The event is captured by `_emit_since()` and published through the existing
     Redis → WebSocket pipeline with no changes to `simulation.py`.

2. **Frontend overlay live reasoning** (`frontend/src/components/simulation/EventDetail.tsx`):
   - Added `liveEvents?: NormalisedEvent[]` prop.
   - Added `eventToDecisionRow()` helper: converts a live `ai_decision` event to a
     `DecisionRow` for uniform rendering.
   - Added `findLiveDecision()` helper: if the clicked event IS an `ai_decision`, uses
     it directly; otherwise searches backwards from `clickedIndex` for the nearest
     prior `ai_decision` with matching `turn`, `player`, and `action_type`.
   - Live decision is computed synchronously — no `useEffect`, no async delay.
   - Live reasoning blocks are tagged with a `live` badge (`data-testid="event-detail-live-reasoning"`).
   - DB fetch still runs when `event.match_id` is present (post-completion enrichment).
   - "No AI decision recorded" message updated to "AI reasoning has not been persisted yet."

3. **`SimulationLive.tsx`** — passes `liveEvents={events}` to `<EventDetail>`.

4. **`LiveConsole.tsx`** — added `ai_decision` case: renders compact
   `🤖 ACTION_TYPE — "reasoning preview…"` in purple, clickable like any other event.
   **NOTE: This visible rendering was removed in session 14** — `ai_decision` events
   should not appear as console rows; reasoning belongs only in the tile overlay.

| `docs/STATUS.md` | This file |
| `docs/CHANGELOG.md` | Session 13 entry added |

## Session 12 Work (2026-05-06)

### Goal

Resolve four remaining STATUS.md effect-engine gaps:
1. Metrics inconsistency between Authoritative Metrics table and session notes.
2. `incoming_damage_reduction` timing bug (cleared before opponent attacks).
3. Three NOOP stubs: Iron Defender, Premium Power Pro, Cinderace Explosiveness.
4. Missing public-path coverage for Risky Ruins evolved special-effect bench placement.

### Completed

1. **STATUS.md metrics table corrected** — Authoritative Metrics table updated to `542 passed,
   1 skipped` (session 12 baseline). Historical counts preserved with session labels.
   Root cause: the old `504/7` figure was session 10 without Postgres running (DB-integration
   tests in `test_scheduled.py` were skipped). Session 11 with the full stack running was
   `522/1`. Session 12 adds 20 new tests → `542/1`.

2. **`incoming_damage_reduction` timing fix** (`backend/app/engine/runner.py`):
   - The bug: `_end_turn()` unconditionally reset `incoming_damage_reduction = 0` for ALL
     Pokémon of BOTH players at the end of every turn, destroying protection set by the current
     player before the opponent had a chance to attack.
   - Fix: moved `incoming_damage_reduction` resets (for `.active` and all `.bench` Pokémon)
     inside the `if pid != current_pid:` block, mirroring the existing pattern already used
     for `attack_damage_reduction` and `cant_retreat_next_turn`.

3. **Jasmine's Gaze new-Pokémon clause** (`backend/app/engine/effects/trainers.py`):
   - Added `player.opponent_next_turn_all_reduction += 30` alongside existing per-Pokémon
     reduction. This covers Pokémon that come into play AFTER the effect fires.
   - Added `opponent_next_turn_all_reduction: int = 0` to `PlayerState` (`state.py`).
   - Applied in `_apply_damage()` (`attacks.py`): checked for the defender's player state.
   - Cleared in `_end_turn()` at `pid != current_pid` (same timing as per-card reduction).

4. **Iron Defender (me01-118)** — NOOP stub replaced with real implementation:
   - `_iron_defender_b18` now sets `player.metal_type_damage_reduction += 30`.
   - Added `metal_type_damage_reduction: int = 0` to `PlayerState`.
   - Applied in `_apply_damage()`: if defender player has `metal_type_damage_reduction > 0`
     and the defender is Metal-type, subtract it from total damage.
   - Cleared at `pid != current_pid` in `_end_turn()`.
   - Card text: "During your opponent's next turn, all of your {M} Pokémon take 30 less
     damage from attacks … (includes new Pokémon that come into play)."

5. **Premium Power Pro (me01-124 / me02.5-199)** — NOOP stub replaced with real implementation:
   - `_premium_power_pro_b18` now sets `player.fighting_pokemon_damage_bonus += 30`.
   - Added `fighting_pokemon_damage_bonus: int = 0` to `PlayerState`.
   - Applied in `_apply_damage()`: if attacker player has bonus > 0 and attacker is Fighting-type,
     bonus is added BEFORE W/R and defense effects (matches "before applying Weakness and Resistance").
   - Cleared at `pid == current_pid` in `_end_turn()` (same-turn effect).
   - Corrected the previous NOOP comment: card text says YOUR Fighting Pokémon, not "each player's".

6. **Cinderace Explosiveness (me01-028)** — setup-phase placement hooks implemented:
   - `RuleEngine.deck_has_basic()` (`rules.py`): recognizes `me01-028` as a valid starting card.
   - `ActionValidator._setup_actions()` (`actions.py`): includes `me01-028` in `PLACE_ACTIVE`
     options during SETUP phase (alongside Basics).
   - `RandomPlayer.choose_setup()` and `BasePlayer.choose_setup()` (`players/base.py`):
     include `me01-028` in Basic-eligible candidates for Active slot selection.
   - Card text: "If this Pokémon is in your hand when you are setting up to play, you may put
     it face down in the Active Spot."

7. **Risky Ruins `bench_pokemon_from_effect` helper** (`backend/app/engine/transitions.py`):
   - Added public `bench_pokemon_from_effect(state, player_id, card, source_zone, *, allow_evolved=False)`.
   - Moves a Pokémon from any source zone to the Bench via a card effect.
   - Enforces bench size limit; rejects evolved Pokémon unless `allow_evolved=True`.
   - Triggers Risky Ruins (me01-127) for Basic non-Darkness Pokémon exactly as the standard
     `_play_basic` and `_place_bench` paths do.
   - Emits `bench_from_effect` and optionally `risky_ruins_damage` events.

### Audit discipline

This was **not** an audit session. `docs/AUDIT_STATE.md` was not advanced.
No DB-backed audit was performed. Cursor is unchanged.



### Goal

Fix the GitHub Actions Playwright E2E workflow. The `Run database migrations` step was
failing because `backend/alembic/env.py` read `sqlalchemy.url` from `backend/alembic.ini`
(hardcoded `localhost:5433`) instead of using the `DATABASE_URL` env var already set in
the container environment. This caused Alembic to attempt a connection to `localhost:5433`
from inside the Docker container, which fails.

### Completed

1. **`backend/alembic/env.py` — honor `DATABASE_URL` env var:**
   - Added `os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL")` override after `config = context.config`.
   - When `DATABASE_URL` is set (e.g. inside Docker containers), it overrides
     `alembic.ini`'s hardcoded `localhost:5433` URL.
   - Local development fallback through `alembic.ini` is preserved when
     `DATABASE_URL` is not set.

2. **`.github/workflows/e2e.yml` — explicit container-network URLs in `.env`:**
   - Added `DATABASE_URL`, `REDIS_URL`, `NEO4J_URI`, `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` to the
     `cat > .env` heredoc. Makes CI intent explicit and belt-and-suspenders.

3. **`.github/workflows/e2e.yml` — strengthened migration step:**
   - Env sanity check: asserts `DATABASE_URL` does not contain `localhost` and
     does contain `postgres:5432` before running Alembic.
   - Postgres reachability check: writes a small asyncpg script to the runner,
     `docker cp`s it into the backend container, and retries (up to 60s) until
     `SELECT 1` succeeds. Confirms Postgres is reachable from inside the container
     before `alembic upgrade head`.

4. **`.github/workflows/e2e.yml` — added "Seed card pool" step:**
   - Runs `docker compose exec -T backend python /app/scripts/seed_cards.py`
     after migrations. Required for the coverage-page E2E test and deck-builder
     full-stack tests to have real card data.

5. **`.github/workflows/e2e.yml` — added Docker diagnostics on failure:**
   - `if: failure()` step dumps `docker compose ps` + 200-line tail of postgres,
     backend, celery-worker, and frontend logs before the Playwright artifact upload.

### Frontend startup note

`frontend/playwright.config.ts` uses a `webServer` directive that automatically
starts the Vite dev server (`npm run dev -- --host 127.0.0.1 --port 4173`) when
Playwright runs. The Vite dev server proxies `/api` and `/socket.io` to
`http://localhost:8000` (the mapped Docker backend port). The Docker `frontend`
container does not need to be started in CI — Playwright handles it.

### Validation (session 11)

### Audit discipline

This was **not** an audit session. `docs/AUDIT_STATE.md` was not advanced.
No DB-backed audit was performed. Cursor is unchanged.

## Session 10 Work (2026-05-05)

### Goal

Fix the Session 8 fault-injection finding: worker crash blocks the simulation queue for up to 1 hour (Redis/Celery default visibility timeout). Add conservative application-level stale-running detection and safe recovery using opponent-batch checkpointing semantics.

### Completed

1. **Stale-running detection added** (`backend/app/tasks/simulation.py`):
   - `SIMULATION_STALE_RUNNING_MINUTES` constant (default `45`), overridable via `SIMULATION_STALE_RUNNING_MINUTES` env var.
   - `_classify_stale_simulation(db, sim, cutoff)` — returns `'skip'` / `'requeue'` / `'fail'`:
     - `'skip'`: simulation started recently, OR any checkpoint was updated after the cutoff (worker may still be alive).
     - `'requeue'`: stale + no checkpoints, or stale + only zero-persisted running/complete checkpoints.
     - `'fail'`: stale + running checkpoint has partial nonzero `matches_completed` (unsafe to replay without creating duplicate match rows).
   - `_recover_stale_running_simulations(SessionFactory, stale_minutes)` — queries all `running` sims older than threshold with `SELECT FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`, classifies each, then either resets to `queued` (with `error_message` explaining the recovery) or marks `failed`.

2. **`_dispatch_next_queued()` extended** — Phase 0 calls `_recover_stale_running_simulations()` before the active-count check. Recovery errors are caught and logged as non-fatal warnings (they must not block normal dispatch).

3. **Concurrent delivery guard added** to `_run_simulation_async()` — Initial `SELECT` upgraded to `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`; if `sim.status == 'running'` at task start, the worker bails immediately with `{"status": "skipped_duplicate_delivery"}`. This prevents two concurrent workers (stale recovery re-dispatches at T+45m AND Redis eventually redelivers the original unacked message at T+60m) from processing the same simulation.

4. **12 tests added** (`backend/tests/test_tasks/test_scheduled.py`):
   - `TestClassifyStaleSimulation` (6 DB integration tests, skipped when Postgres unreachable):
     - Fresh sim is never classified stale.
     - Stale sim + no checkpoints → requeue.
     - Stale sim + zero-persisted running checkpoint → requeue.
     - Stale sim + completed checkpoints → requeue.
     - Stale sim + partial nonzero running checkpoint → fail.
     - Stale sim but checkpoint updated recently → skip.
   - `TestRecoverStaleRunningSimulations` (2 DB integration tests):
     - Stale requeue changes status to `queued`.
     - Fresh sim not recovered.
   - `TestDispatchQueuedSimulation` (2 mock-based tests, always run):
     - Active running sim blocks dispatch.
     - No active sim dispatches queued.
   - `TestStaleThresholdConfigurable` (2 unit tests, always run):
     - Default threshold is set and positive.
     - `_classify_stale_simulation` respects explicit cutoff overrides.

5. **Live validation** — Injected a fake stale `running` simulation with `started_at = now() - 90 minutes`. Triggered `advance_simulation_queue` manually. Observed in worker logs:
   ```
   Stale-running recovery: requeuing simulation f99c41dc... (started_at=2026-05-05 09:31:54..., threshold=45 min)
   Queue: stale-running recovery affected 1 simulation(s): ['f99c41dc...']
   Queue: dispatched simulation f99c41dc...
   ```
   Simulation recovered and ran to `complete`. Disposable sim deleted. Queue depth 0.

6. **Celery-worker rebuilt** with updated `simulation.py`.

## Session 9 Work (2026-05-05)

### Goal
Add focused regression tests for the five handler bugs fixed in Session 8
(commit `b7af4b7`). No new features. No audit cursor advancement.

### Completed

1. **14 regression tests added** (`backend/tests/test_engine/test_audit_fixes.py`):
   - Ninjask Cast-Off Shell (me01-017): 2 tests — Shedinja benched; no-Shedinja no-op
   - Clawitzer Fall Back to Reload (me01-038): 3 tests — hand-only, Water-only,
     max_count=2; condition true/false
   - Grumpig Energized Steps (me01-063): 1 test — top-4 only, any Basic Energy,
     active+bench targets, any number of attachments
   - Fighting Gong (me01-116): 1 test — Basic included; Stage 1/2 excluded
   - Risky Ruins (me01-127): 5 tests — Basic non-Darkness damaged; Darkness no damage;
     evolved no damage; `_play_basic` non-Darkness and Darkness cases; `_place_bench` evolved

2. **2 latent handler bugs fixed** (`backend/app/engine/effects/abilities.py`) — found
   while authoring the regression tests above:
   - `_fall_back_to_reload` / `_cond_fall_back_to_reload`: called `_energy_provides_type`
     which was never imported in `abilities.py` (defined in `trainers.py`). Any game with
     Clawitzer and Water Energy in hand would fire a `NameError` at runtime.
     Fix: inlined as `"Water" in (c.energy_provides or [])`.
   - `_energized_steps`: `state.emit_event(...)` referenced `action.card_def_id` which
     does not exist on `Action` (has `card_instance_id`). Every Grumpig Energized Steps
     resolution would fire `AttributeError`. Fix: replaced with `action.card_instance_id or ""`.

3. **Docker stack rebuilt and restarted** — celery-worker rebuilt after `abilities.py`
   change; full stack `down && up`; worker confirmed healthy.

### Validation (session 9)

| Command | Result |
|---|---|
| `python3 -m pytest tests/test_engine/test_audit_fixes.py -q` | 88 passed |
| `cd backend && python3 -m pytest tests/ -x -q` | **478 passed, 1 skipped** |
| `docker compose ps` | All 8 services Up/healthy |
| `docker compose logs celery-worker` | `celery@... ready.` — clean start |

Frontend not run — no frontend files changed this session.

### Files Changed (session 9)

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `backend/app/engine/effects/abilities.py` | Fixed `_energy_provides_type` NameError (×2) and `action.card_def_id` AttributeError |
| `backend/tests/test_engine/test_audit_fixes.py` | +14 regression tests |
| `docs/HARDENING_SWEEP_REPORT.md` | Session 9 header + regression coverage table added |
| `docs/STATUS.md` | This file |
| `docs/CHANGELOG.md` | Session 9 entry added |

Commit: `980e510` — pushed to `origin/main`. Working tree clean.

### Audit discipline

This was **not** an audit session. `docs/AUDIT_STATE.md` was not advanced.
No DB-backed audit was performed. Cursor is unchanged.

## Known Issues / Gaps

| Issue | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Section 7B Redis stale-running simulation gap | **Fixed (session 10)** | Application-level stale detection added to `_dispatch_next_queued`. Default threshold: 45 minutes (overridable via `SIMULATION_STALE_RUNNING_MINUTES` env var). See session 10 notes. |
| "Opponent's next turn" damage-reduction timing | **Fixed (session 12)** | `incoming_damage_reduction` reset moved to `pid != current_pid` block in `_end_turn()`. Player-level `opponent_next_turn_all_reduction` and `metal_type_damage_reduction` added for new-Pokémon clause. |
| Iron Defender / Premium Power Pro / Cinderace Explosiveness | **Fixed (session 12)** | Iron Defender: `metal_type_damage_reduction` player-level field. Premium Power Pro: `fighting_pokemon_damage_bonus` player-level field. Cinderace: `deck_has_basic` + `_setup_actions` + `choose_setup` updated. |
| me01-127 Risky Ruins evolved-placement via special effects | **Fixed (session 12)** | `bench_pokemon_from_effect()` helper in `transitions.py` provides public effect-path with Risky Ruins trigger. 4 new tests added. |

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Rebuild celery-worker** with updated engine files:
   `docker compose build celery-worker && docker compose up -d celery-worker`
2. **Next recommended task:** Resume DB-backed card-effect audit from current
   `docs/AUDIT_STATE.md` cursor. Run `docs/AUDIT_RULES.md` workflow.
3. **Or:** Run AI/AI or coach simulations now that the stack is clean and all
   known handler bugs are fixed.

## Operational Caveats

- Any change under `backend/app/engine/effects/` requires rebuilding the celery worker:
  `docker compose build celery-worker && docker compose up -d celery-worker`
- **Stale-running recovery:** simulations stuck `running` for more than `SIMULATION_STALE_RUNNING_MINUTES` (default 45) with no checkpoint activity are automatically requeued by the `advance_simulation_queue` beat task. Set the env var to adjust. Simulations with partial nonzero checkpoint data are marked `failed` rather than requeued (safe default).
- `EnergyAttachment` uses `source_card_id=`, not `card_id=`.
- Do not commit `frontend/node_modules`.
- Do not advance `docs/AUDIT_STATE.md` without performing a real DB-backed audit per `docs/AUDIT_RULES.md`.
- Do not reset the database unless explicitly instructed.
